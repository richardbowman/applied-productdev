Sure, ideas are hard, processes are hard, but without the right team working together effectively, it will be hard to achieve any vision. So the playbook starts here, because if you aren't willing to consider how you've configured your team and the right people who can fit this model, its unlikely the processes and activities we've described will work. Make sure you've read the Leadership Principles necessary to support these teams. Introduction to Team Structures \u00b6 At the highest level, we believe its important to create complete teams that we minimize interdependencies. Breaking each of these down: Complete teams: cross-functional teams able to ideate, discover, test, build, and deploy product capabilities associated to a specific outcome or set of outcomes. Minimize inter-dependencies: this is the key to maximizing autonomy, scale, and velocity. Leaders goals should be primarily to keep refining how they support the reduction of blockers that emerge from cross-team interdependencies by making each team more complete. Complete Teams: Cross-functional & Durable Teams \u00b6 You may want to give these a unique name to stand out, such as \u201csquads\u201d or \u201cpods\u201d, but the nature of these teams are the following: They are durable. No team can keep switching initiatives, customer segments, product components, and/or technologies every sprint or even every quarter and be expected to build a true understanding of the market or be held accountable to business outcomes, Great leaders give teams objectives that span 6-12mo or more. It is critical that the smallest team that takes on an objective is the \u201ctriad\u201d so that the key capabilities are present for all of the activities at the earliest stages. If you have or are willing to build a strong Product Marketing and/or Product Research function, consider also including these roles in your core team configuration. Design early teams so that they have a solid base to expand. Consider the experience of your product managers and designers, and ensure they have achievable outcomes based on their skills and experience. It is very easy to budget and plan around the durable team model. This can be integrated directly into strategic business planning. #todo: See [[Initiative-based budgeting]] Expertise Building vs. Utility Player \u00b6 Sr. more specialized team members are less clear how they fit in Can more sr. People not feel,like they have enough sphere of influence Minimize Inter-dependencies: Clear outcomes \u00b6 Ways to organize teams: One way to think about dependencies and team organization is around the product's capabilities or modules, which can work. At the core, the team organizational structure only works if individual teams clearly own certain objectives. Recommended Reading \u00b6 When switching to cross-functional teams, changing management style is difficult. Luckily, a lot of excellent material has been written on this subject. Leading Teams, by Richard Hackman. Harvard professor Richard Hackman is a long-time team researcher. His book is currently our favorite team-related book. It has a strong focus on helping management in their change to team-based work. Leading Self-Directed Work Teams, by Kimball Fisher. This book has a strong focus on the change in role when one becomes a team leader of a self-directed team. The Wisdom of Teams, by Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith. This is probably the most popular team reference and certainly worth reading. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. Written like a novel, it covers well the need for conflict in teams. Cross-functional teams are described mainly in product development literature. Some good texts: Fast Cycle Time, by Chris Meyer. This is a true classic on product development and talks about cross-functional (multifunctional) teams in detail. Revolutionizing Product Development, by Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark. Another classic in product development literature; has one chapter on cross-functional integration. Some texts related to software development teams: Software for Your Head, by Jim and Michele McCarthy. Jim and Michele spent years in \u2018boot camps\u2019 to find the most efficient ways for teams to work. They documented this as a set of protocols in this book. Peopleware, by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister. This classic on the importance of people in software development also has a couple of chapters focusing on teams. 3.

Leaders goals should be primarily to keep refining how they support the reduction of blockers that emerge from cross-team interdependencies by making each team more complete.","title":"Introduction to Team Structures"},{"location":"Sections/Building%20the%20Right%20Team/#complete-teams-cross-functional-durable-teams","text":"You may want to give these a unique name to stand out, such as \u201csquads\u201d or \u201cpods\u201d, but the nature of these teams are the following: They are durable. No team can keep switching initiatives, customer segments, product components, and/or technologies every sprint or even every quarter and be expected to build a true understanding of the market or be held accountable to business outcomes, Great leaders give teams objectives that span 6-12mo or more. It is critical that the smallest team that takes on an objective is the \u201ctriad\u201d so that the key capabilities are present for all of the activities at the earliest stages. If you have or are willing to build a strong Product Marketing and/or Product Research function, consider also including these roles in your core team configuration. Design early teams so that they have a solid base to expand. Consider the experience of your product managers and designers, and ensure they have achievable outcomes based on their skills and experience. It is very easy to budget and plan around the durable team model. This can be integrated directly into strategic business planning. #todo: See [[Initiative-based budgeting]]","title":"Complete Teams: Cross-functional &amp; Durable Teams"},{"location":"Sections/Building%20the%20Right%20Team/#expertise-building-vs-utility-player","text":"Sr. more specialized team members are less clear how they fit in Can more sr.

Luckily, a lot of excellent material has been written on this subject. Leading Teams, by Richard Hackman. Harvard professor Richard Hackman is a long-time team researcher. His book is currently our favorite team-related book. It has a strong focus on helping management in their change to team-based work. Leading Self-Directed Work Teams, by Kimball Fisher. This book has a strong focus on the change in role when one becomes a team leader of a self-directed team. The Wisdom of Teams, by Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith. This is probably the most popular team reference and certainly worth reading. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. Written like a novel, it covers well the need for conflict in teams. Cross-functional teams are described mainly in product development literature. Some good texts: Fast Cycle Time, by Chris Meyer. This is a true classic on product development and talks about cross-functional (multifunctional) teams in detail. Revolutionizing Product Development, by Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark. Another classic in product development literature; has one chapter on cross-functional integration. Some texts related to software development teams: Software for Your Head, by Jim and Michele McCarthy. Jim and Michele spent years in \u2018boot camps\u2019 to find the most efficient ways for teams to work. They documented this as a set of protocols in this book. Peopleware, by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister. This classic on the importance of people in software development also has a couple of chapters focusing on teams. 3.

Ideas aren't as valuable as you hope \u00b6 This can't be overstated enough. Most ideas you will have for your product, while they might be considered \"cool\", \"interesting\" or \"impressive\" by your customers won't actually cause customers to change their current process and adopt or pay for your new solution to their problems. Inertia is a challenge and your product must be substantially better to overcome switching costs. Your first iteration won't be that valuable \u00b6 Even when you believe you've performed product discovery work that validates a deep customer problem, a willingness to adopt new solutions, and most over, a willingness to commit resources for a new product, the reality is that when a customer begins to use the \"MVP\" solution you've identified, you will gain substantially clarity on required iterations to achieve the value you'd hoped with customers. Inertia of older working models \u00b6 Even more challenging, most organizations believe product discovery is important conceptually, but they are stuck in various stages of having built some sort of semi-agile scrum-fall proces for product development that still relies on substantial stakeholder involvement for roadmap development through a primarily stage-gate innovation process. This means the idea of creating a true working cadence and work lane for \"discovery\" can be challenging since we've been taught by agile development that pumping out working software is the primary measure of success. This means many organizations have adopted rigorous velocity tracking and other tools to try and optimize the delivery of software. Output vs outcomes \u00b6 This will be a fundamental tenant of this playbook - if your team focuses its product roadmaps on being a \"feature factory\" where the overall structure of the team is designed to ship ideas without any validation, you might be fast, and you might get lucky, but will you really know what parts of your product are resonating, which you should double down on, which are not valuable?","title":"Challenges in Product Development"},{"location":"Sections/Challenges%20in%20Product%20Development/#challenges-in-product-development","text":"","title":"Challenges in Product Development"},{"location":"Sections/Challenges%20in%20Product%20Development/#ugly-truths-we-must-overcome","text":"There are a number of fundamental flaws inherent in development of new products, and acknowledging them and aligning to these truths as a team is what helps teams develop processes, techniques, and approaches that align to mitigating the most challenging aspects of new product development.","title":"Ugly truths we must overcome"},{"location":"Sections/Challenges%20in%20Product%20Development/#ideas-arent-as-valuable-as-you-hope","text":"This can't be overstated enough.

What is Continuous Discovery? \u00b6 The idea of continuous discovery is that instead of having a waterfall or stage-gate approach to research, discovery should be embedded and ingrained into the functions of all product teams. As written in [[Continuous Discovery Habits]], \"Today, many teams are adopting, developing, and iterating on their own continuous discovery practices.

We've gotten pretty good at it. Most teams are using either Kanban or Scrum-based processes to deliver product capabilities to end users. This playbook assumes the team is using a Scrum-based delivery process with a set cadence, typically two weeks in length. Fixing time in scrum is a mechanism for creating one constraint in the traditional project management triad. Discovery \u00b6 This cycle is typically the area that we ether aren't performing in any legitimate way, or is highly ad-hoc. Because this area is less defined by typical methodologies, the playbook will spend more time creating a structure for this lane. Cycles \u00b6 One thing we'll have to keep in mind here is that it is much harder to declare a certain structured cycle for product discovery. If you do, you'll inevitably just start arriving at sunk-cost based choices where you budgeted 3mo for a discovery initiative, and whatever came out of the research will get built whether or not is a good idea or not. Its key here to try to kill a lot of ideas in the search of one that stands out. Ideally a discovery cycle could be as short as a day, and you might have several iterations within a single traditional iteration. In Jeff Patton's diagram, he represents this with lots more cycles in discovery happening than in the development sprints. Ceremonies \u00b6 We recommend using the same cycle and sharing ceremonies across both product discovery and delivery, and just segregating time within key ceremonies to allow for the planning and progression of both lanes. It keeps the full pod integrated in both discovery and delivery even if in planning process you carve off a portion of the team that will be executing portions of either lane.

About process maps \u00b6 This is not a sexy new tool, the process map was developed in 1921 and quickly adopted into industrial engineering curriculm. And the technique expanded to business processes in the early 1930s. Here are the basic symbols you'll use, which should be available in any diagramming tool. How to discover a process map \u00b6 You may now be asking how exactly you go about mapping your business processes. To do it right, you want a formal procedure. The following is a useful framework. Step 1: Identify the Process You Need to Map \u00b6 Decide where you want to start. Is it with the process that is underperforming? Is it with the process that is important to your new strategy? Or is it with the process that directly makes an impact on customer satisfaction? And then give it a name. Step 2: Bring Together the Right Team \u00b6 The input of everyone involved in the process is necessary to make sure that you cover every aspect of the process when mapping it. The right team should include those who do and manage the process and provides the input . Consider using lessons and techniques covered in the [[Stakeholder Interview]] topic for these sessions. Step 3: Gather All the Necessary Information \u00b6 Where does the process begin and end? What are the steps in between these two points? What are the inputs and the outputs of the process? Who does what? When, where and how? Step 4: Organize the Steps in a Sequential Order \u00b6 Get your team to arrange each step in a sequential order from the beginning to the end. Step 5: Draw the Baseline Process Map \u00b6 Draw a process map that shows the map as it is currently. - Before identifying the process steps, start with identifying the start and end points of the process. This helps with setting limits - Make your process maps as easy and simple as possible to read and understand by anyone in your company - Keep only the necessary details on your map. Not less or more than needed to identify areas for improvements - Make sure you use the correct process map symbols when drawing to avoid confusion - Include all the key stakeholders when mapping the process to avoid missing out on important information or steps The following are the specific criteria that you are looking for in every process: - Responsibilities - Objectives - Activities - Inputs - Outputs - Customers - Risks and controls - Key performance indicators Step 5: Analyze the Map to Find Areas for Improvement \u00b6 Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks within the processes. What are the steps that should be eliminated? Where can you make improvements? Select a process improvement plan. Process innovation analyses should consider Steven Shapiro\u2019s 7 R\u2019s of process innovation: Rethink Reconfigure Resequence Relocate Reduce Reassign Retool Step 6: Implement Improvements and Monitor Them \u00b6 Implement the improvements on a smaller scale at first. If they work better, you can apply it on a larger scale. Monitor the new and improved process to see how it is functioning and whether it needs further optimization.
