# Building the Right Team

It's hard to argue that the most important aspect of building great products is having a great team. Sure, ideas are hard, processes are hard, but without the right team working together effectively, it will be hard to achieve any vision. So the playbook starts here, because if you aren't willing to consider how you've configured your team and the right people who can fit this model, its unlikely the processes and activities we've described will work. Make sure you've read the [[Leadership Principles]] necessary to support these teams.

## Introduction to Team Structures

At the highest level, we believe its important to create complete teams that we minimize interdependencies. Breaking each of these down:

- Complete teams: cross-functional teams able to ideate, discover, test, build, and deploy product capabilities associated to a specific outcome or set of outcomes.
- Minimize inter-dependencies: this is the key to maximizing autonomy, scale, and velocity. Leaders goals should be primarily to keep refining how they support the reduction of blockers that emerge from cross-team interdependencies by making each team more complete.


## Complete Teams: Cross-functional & Durable Teams

You may want to give these a unique name to stand out, such as “squads” or “pods”, but the nature of these teams are the following:

-   They are durable. No team can keep switching initiatives, customer segments, product components,  and/or technologies every sprint or even every quarter and be expected to build a true understanding of the market or be held accountable to business outcomes,  Great leaders give teams objectives that span 6-12mo or more.
-   It is critical that the smallest team that takes on an objective is the “triad” so that the key capabilities are present for all of the activities at the earliest stages. If you have or are willing to build a strong Product Marketing and/or Product Research function, consider also including these roles in your  core team configuration.    
-   Design early teams so that they have a solid base to expand. Consider the experience of your product managers and designers, and ensure they have achievable outcomes based on their skills and experience.  
-   It is very easy to budget and plan around the durable team model. This can be integrated directly into strategic business planning. #todo: See [[Initiative-based budgeting]]

## Expertise Building vs. Utility Player  
- Sr. more specialized team members are less clear how they fit in  
- Can more sr. People not feel,like they have enough sphere of influence

## Minimize Inter-dependencies: Clear outcomes

Ways to organize teams:

One way to think about dependencies and team organization is around the product's capabilities or modules, which can work. At the core, the team organizational structure only works if individual teams clearly own certain objectives.
