# Process Mapping Activity


## When is this relevant?

This technique is relevant when there is a business process being performed to service product capabilities that isn't fully automated, or even if the current iteration is fully automated, customers or stakeholders have a manual process they perform that they believe is more effective.

## About process maps

This is not a sexy new tool, the process map was developed in 1921 and quickly adopted into industrial engineering curriculm. And the technique expanded to business processes in the early 1930s.

Here are the basic symbols you'll use, which should be available in any diagramming tool.

## How to discover a process map

You may now be asking how exactly you go about mapping your business processes. To do it right, you want a formal procedure. The following is a useful framework.

#### Step 1: Identify the Process You Need to Map

Decide where you want to start. Is it with the process that is underperforming? Is it with the process that is important to your new strategy? Or is it with the process that directly makes an impact on customer satisfaction? And then give it a name.

#### Step 2: Bring Together the Right Team

The input of everyone involved in the process is necessary to make sure that you cover every aspect of the process when mapping it. The right team should **include those who do and manage the process and provides the input**. Consider using lessons and techniques covered in the [[Stakeholder Interview]] topic for these sessions.

#### Step 3: Gather All the Necessary Information

-   Where does the process begin and end?
-   What are the steps in between these two points?
-   What are the inputs and the outputs of the process?
-   Who does what? When, where and how?

#### Step 4: Organize the Steps in a Sequential Order

Get your team to arrange each step in a sequential order from the beginning to the end.

#### Step 5: Draw the Baseline Process Map

Draw a process map that shows the map as it is currently.
-   Before identifying the process steps, start with identifying the start and end points of the process. This helps with setting limits
-   Make your process maps as easy and simple as possible to read and understand by anyone in your company
-   Keep only the necessary details on your map. Not less or more than needed to identify areas for improvements
-   Make sure you use the correct process map symbols when drawing to avoid confusion
-   Include all the key stakeholders when mapping the process to avoid missing out on important information or steps

The following are the specific criteria that you are looking for in every process:
-   Responsibilities
-   Objectives
-   Activities
-   Inputs
-   Outputs
-   Customers
-   Risks and controls
-   Key performance indicators


#### Step 5: Analyze the Map to Find Areas for Improvement

Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks within the processes. What are the steps that should be eliminated? Where can you make improvements? Select a process improvement plan. Process innovation analyses should consider [Steven Shapiro’s 7 R’s](http://www.knooppuntinnovatie.nl/documenten/24-7%20innovation.pdf) of process innovation:

1.  Rethink
2.  Reconfigure
3.  Resequence
4.  Relocate
5.  Reduce
6.  Reassign
7.  Retool


#### Step 6: Implement Improvements and Monitor Them

Implement the improvements on a smaller scale at first. If they work better, you can apply it on a larger scale. Monitor the new and improved process to see how it is functioning and whether it needs further optimization.
