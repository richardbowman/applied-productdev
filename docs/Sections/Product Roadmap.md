Avoid output-driven roadmaps
We want outcome-driven roadmaps


Roadmaps vs Release Plans

A Release Plan is a list of features and dates.
A Roadmap on the other hand is a document intended to communicate the strategic direction of the company — what are our goals, what are our outcomes, and how will we win in the market.

Primary outcome a customer-driven roadmap should focus on outcomes that show measurable change in customer behavior, or a measurable change in customer impact.

I.e. will you be satisfied if you have a release plan that says Feature X is released in the Spring, and then you do that, but no one uses it? Will you leave the feature in place? Remove it? Iterate on it? Does your roadmap allow for that, or does it move on to the next feature?

Vision —> Strategy —> Outcomes —> Opportunities




Opportunities = customer problems/pains/gains/jobs
