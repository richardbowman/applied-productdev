# How we built this playbook

## Introduction

This playbook is meant to be an artifact that provides a holistic explanation of the approach used by a company’s product, design, and engineering functions to build digital software solutions that customers love. There is not a strong industry-standard approach to product management. Having interviewed dozens of product leaders, most have built their own process with their teams at their own respective companies.

We didn't want to give this playbook a fancy trademarked name with a new trademarked process. Instead this playbook is effectively built by reading, processing, and consuming the latest product literature and knowledge from the industry into a usable set of tools and techniques.  I will call this out everywhere I can - this isn’t a one-off that is unique (or somehow going to disrupt your competitors because only you will know about it), but instead a practical toolkit to apply all of the modern thinking in the world of digital product development.

This template is meant to be a product-playbook-in-a-box, but each organizational will want to adapt. This playbook doesn't aspire to be the one process to solve all of the problems, but as an accelerator to you as a product leader who needs to not start from scratch or just start from principles to get a solid product process moving.

## Tools used in playbook
We've attempted to be as tool agnostic as possible, but also want to make this playbook able to be used on day 1. The contents itself is written in Obsidian Markdown, and document and spreadsheet templates are built in LibreOffice Open Document format which can be imported into either Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, or other tools as needed. Things get harder at the diagramming and collaboration templates level. We've working primarily in Excalidraw since it is open source and can support diagrams as well as collaboration.
