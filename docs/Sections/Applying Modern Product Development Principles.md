# Applying Modern Product Development

Before you decide to align your team to this playbook, you'll want to make sure that you and your team share the common underlying set of principles & beliefs with our philosophy (and those whose ideas we've amalgamated). The playbook works based on these principles.

## Principles to combat the core challenges
Modern product teams have nearly all adopted or seek to adopt these fundamental principles in how to work. We won't revisit these, but the playbook will build heavily on these principles that help us mitigate the fundamental flaws.

### Multidisciplinary autonomous teams build better products

Today, the possibilities offered by modern technology means that the best ideas won't just emerge from team members with strong business domain experience, or strong usability experience. Great ideas will emerge from technologists who understand how a potential new type of technology could actually enable experiences that were not possible in the past.

### Product teams must be deeply connected with customers

A massive gap that still seems to exist in many product teams is a lack of connection between the builders and the customers. We often for efficiency reasons suggest "well our sales team is talking to customers all day" or "our business leaders have the pulse on the trends and competition" and delegate most of our customer research to stakeholders. While their perspectives are valuable, every member of a product team will make stronger decisions by building first-hand perspective on the needs, wants, desires, and problems of customers.

## Could this be the wrong playbook for you?

Yes! The principles above rely on a strong management discipline of autonomy, trust, and distributed decision-making. If you do not believe your company culture contains those elements or truly wants to build these cultures, this playbook is likely not right for you.
