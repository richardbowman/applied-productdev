# Showcase

## Introduction
This session is an expansion of the typical agile Sprint Demo meeting where teams show off the work they've completed during the iteration.

## When to use
- Every iteration
- All teams should participate, ideally with their own clear timeblocks so that stakeholders can attend as relevant, or the whole thing.

## How to run
Typically, suggest about 30min per team, and split their showcase across both delivery and discovery.

This is an easy meeting to run, and should be fun! This is not a good forum to ask a ton of questions, but should focus on being a [[How we built this playbook#review|Review]] meeting that is focused on radiating information across the team.
