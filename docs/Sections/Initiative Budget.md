# Initiative Budget

## Introduction
An initiative budget describes the set of investments the product and engineering teams intend to take on, and serves as a key part of the product strategy process to ensure you have the resources allocated to product roadmap items.

## When to use
This artifact should be revised on a regular basis, such as quarterly, to drive reallocation of resources as needed (remembering durability is a key), and a heavily used tool in annual budget planning.

## How to maintain
This budget should be directly connected to the [[Opportunity Backlog]] using the same Opportunity IDs to represent the problem/solution spaces that the business believes has potential value and viability for investment.

Ensuring each initiative is described via a clear objective and key results helps ensure the problem has even been groomed at the appropriate level to take on assigning a team to it. The OKRs shown in the [[Initiative Budget]] should be developed using the [[Discovery - Opportunity Grooming]] activity.

## Who maintains
Product leadership is accountable for maintaining this artifact. (See [[applied-productdev/docs/Sections/Team Roles & Responsibilities#Accountable]])
