# Iteration Planning

## Introduction

This concept is stolen from SAFE Agile and is designed to coordinate across multiple product teams.

## When to use
Many firms do iteration planning every 3 sprints, but if this seems too frequent (i.e. you've minimized interdependencies), consider a quarterly process.

## Prerequisites
Teams have independently groomed and prioritized their work

## How to run

This typically takes a full day:

- Product leader shares overarching learning, priorities
- Teams product managers share their team's prioritized backlog
- Teams breakout to review interdependencies with other teams
- Teams share interdependencies, reorganize sprints as needed to mitigate
- Teams commit
- Retrospective

## Artifacts
- [[Sprint Backlog]] - teams should end with a sprint backlog for the upcoming series of sprints based on your iteration cycles.
