# Building on Agile and Lean

This playbook layers on top of agile and lean principles as the software industry has been doing since the early 2000s. But you've likely felt the limitations in your team of just talking about these principle and methods as they relate to modern development.

## Limitations of Agile
- no clear way to scale - multiple scaling methodologies
- agile primarily focuses on delivery work as the primary goal, with the manifesto stating we "prioritize working software over documentation" for instance. while the idea is right, this concept can be a hinderance to effective discovery if your team has driven a priority on velocity as the key  (agile helped weak teams justify a output over outcomes model)
- a limited list or "sprint backlog" as the primary organizing tool that struggles to differentiate between problem and solution space.

## Limitations of Lean
- meant for repeatable activities in manufacturing
- product development isn't repeatable, most problems are different

# Positives from both of these methods
#todo back up/review
- Autonomous teams
- Limit work in progress
- Iterative structure
- Habitual practices
- Scaled Agile


# Evolving beyond
#todo back up/review
- Product Flow
- Self-managing teams From Lean - Managers as Teachers
- Outcome-driven results through OKRs
- Squads, scaled agile structures
