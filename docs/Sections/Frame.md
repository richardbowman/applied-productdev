# Frame

To correctly identify challenges, you must understand the underlying user needs you want to solve with the product. At this stage, product teams rely heavily on quantitative and qualitative research to find data to support (or disprove) their hypothesis.

Depending on the scale and complexity of isolating and declaring a key problem area to focus your energy, teams should spend anywhere from a couple hours to weeks on framing.
