# Opp Assessment

## High-Level
The three most important questions on an opportunity assessment are:

**Objective**: What problem are we trying to solve? (why are we doing this)
**Persona**: Who are we trying to solve this problem for? (target persona)
**Key Results**: How will we know if we succeed? (what is the outcome we are hoping for)

Suggest that this high-level assessment can just be maintained as columns in the [[Opportunity Backlog]]

## Holistic

For a more complete assessment, consider this broader question set:

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)
2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)
3. How big is the opportunity? (market size)
4. What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)
5. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)
6. Why now? (market window)
7. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)
8. How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)
9. What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)\
10. Given the above, whatâ€™s the recommendation? (go or no-go)
