# Team Evolution

Rather than transition work from one pod to another as its stage evolves, instead, change the pod's configuration. Use it as an opportunity for internal mobility, clear budgeting process, and to coincide with the natural reduction in investment in other initiatives.


## Growing a discovery pod: New initiative progressing from discovery to MVP

## Winding down support pods


## Splitting a pod: multiple discovery initiatives in squad have potential

- recommend you don't turn one squad into pure delivery/support and one into the "new/cool" idea squad. Try to decompose a share of new potential capability as well as more iterative metric improvements that split up the former squad's current capabilities.
