# Continuous Discovery

## What is Product Discovery?

Product Discovery is the concept of researching, building knowledge, learning from customers, brainstorming, and exploring potential solutions to customer problems in a particular space with the goal of building and delivering a new product to support the customer needs.

## What is Continuous Discovery?

The idea of continuous discovery is that instead of having a waterfall or stage-gate approach to research, discovery should be embedded and ingrained into the functions of all product teams.

As written in [[Continuous Discovery Habits]], "Today, many teams are adopting, developing, and iterating on their own continuous discovery practices. They are engaging with customers on a regular basis. They are testing their assumptions. Rather than just validating their ideas, they are co-creating with customers—combining the team’s knowledge of what’s technically possible with the customer’s knowledge of their own needs, pain points, and desires to build better products."

## Leveraging continuous discovery in practice

This guide is about actually applying modern theory, and we all know that its easier in theory to get the balance of discovery and delivery aligned. In practice, its challenging, and many teams will fall back to delivery in a continuous model. We will describe in this playbook a concrete approach to dedicating time across a cross-functional team to product discovery.

The way in practice we will recommend implementing an integrated discovery and delivery process is through the use of a dual-track process. We will separate the cadences and time commitments of the two tracks. The downsides of this approach is that it can be challenging to decide if an idea is really either a "delivery" initiative or a "discovery" initiative.
