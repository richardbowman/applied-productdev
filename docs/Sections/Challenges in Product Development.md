# Challenges in Product Development

## Ugly truths we must overcome
There are a number of fundamental flaws inherent in  development of new products, and acknowledging them and aligning to these truths as a team is what helps teams develop processes, techniques, and approaches that align to mitigating the most challenging aspects of new product development.

### Ideas aren't as valuable as you hope
This can't be overstated enough. Most ideas you will have for your product, while they might be considered "cool", "interesting" or "impressive" by your customers won't actually cause customers to change their current process and adopt or pay for your new solution to their problems. Inertia is a challenge and your product must be *substantially* better to overcome switching costs.

### Your first iteration won't be that valuable
Even when you believe you've performed product discovery work that validates a deep customer problem, a willingness to adopt new solutions, and most over, a willingness to commit resources for a new product, the reality is that when a customer begins to use the "MVP" solution you've identified, you will gain substantially clarity on required iterations to achieve the value you'd hoped with customers.

## Inertia of older working models
Even more challenging, most organizations believe product discovery is important conceptually, but they are stuck in various stages of having built some sort of semi-agile scrum-fall proces for product development that still relies on substantial stakeholder involvement for roadmap development through a primarily stage-gate innovation process.

This means the idea of creating a true working cadence and work lane for "discovery" can be challenging since we've been taught by agile development that pumping out working software is the primary measure of success. This means many organizations have adopted rigorous velocity tracking and other tools to try and optimize the delivery of software.

### Output vs outcomes

This will be a fundamental tenant of this playbook - if your team focuses its product roadmaps on being a "feature factory" where the overall structure of the team is designed to ship ideas without any validation, you might be fast, and you might get lucky, but will you really know what parts of your product are resonating, which you should double down on, which are not valuable?
