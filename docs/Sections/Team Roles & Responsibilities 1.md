# Team Roles and Responsibilities

In modern teams where we ask for all team members work together to act collaboratively, it can be confusing in less mature teams (or mature teams who just prefer less questions and more command and control) how to operate in this model.

We still recommend modeling a simple roles and responsibilities matrix that breaks down the accountable party for various decisions in the product development process.

| Activity           | Product | Design | Engineering | Quality | DevOps | Business |     |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ----- |
| Prioritize backlog | A       | R      | R           | R       | R      | C        |

## About RACI

### Responsible
People or stakeholders who do the work. They must complete the task or objective or make the decision. Several people can be jointly _Responsible_.

### Accountable
Person or stakeholder who is the "owner" of the work. He or she must sign off or approve when the task, objective or decision is complete. This person must make sure that responsibilities are assigned in the matrix for all related activities. Success requires that there is only one person _Accountable_, which means that "the buck stops there."

### Consulted
People or stakeholders who need to give input before the work can be done and signed-off on. These people are "in the loop" and active participants.

### Informed
People or stakeholders who need to be kept "in the picture." They need updates on progress or decisions, but they do not need to be formally consulted, nor do they contribute directly to the task or decision.
