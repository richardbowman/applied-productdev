# Simplified Discovery Workflow

In the simplified flow, we use a more linear discovery process. This is a good way to get started for many teams that aren't performing discovery in a team-based approach yet. As the team evolves, you'll find the linear process is limiting, and you can move on to [[Advanced Continous Delivery Flow]].
