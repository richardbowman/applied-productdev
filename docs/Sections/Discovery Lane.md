# Discovery Lane
As we discussed in [[Applying Modern Product Development Principles]], the key principles of this playbook is that fundamentally it is challenging to find an idea with substantially enough [[Product Market Fit (PMF)]] to create a viable business. Once it does, it's likely to need multiple iterations to achieve that value.

## Discovery budget
#todo how to carve out dedicated time for discovery across various pod members?

## Technique Areas
1. [[Frame]] - clarify the problem space
2. [[Plan]] - refine discovery plan
3. [[Ideate]] - develop ideas for potential solutions
4. [[Prototype]] - build concepts to test solution
5. [[Test]] - confirm mitigation stratgies for value, usability, feasibility, and viability risks
6. [[Refine]] - prep the validated idea for delivery lane
