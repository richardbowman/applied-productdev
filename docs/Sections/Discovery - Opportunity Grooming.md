# Opportunity Grooming

## Introduction
The Opportunity [[How we built this playbook#Grooming|Grooming]] [[How we built this playbook#Activity|Activity]] is a [[How we built this playbook#Ceremony|Ceremony]] where the team refines incoming ideas, problems, potential solutions to ensure they are logged, prioritized, and have initial framing that helps select appropriate opportunities for investment by teams.

## When to use
Suggest that most teams meet weekly, and depending on the backlog health, dedicate 1-3+hrs for session.

## How to run

### Agenda
1. Review new items - here, make sure the full triad is on the same page with the basic understanding of the item. Make notes as needed from the conversation. If its unclear to all (let's say you allow open idea submission from the team), establish a next step to perform a [[Stakeholder Interview]] to understand more about the opportunity.
2. For existing items that are in the "In Consideration" phase, pick off an item from the list and:
	1.  Align if this opportunity is complex enough to warrant discovery, or if its a simple bug fix or small enhancement that can be transferred directly to the [[Product Delivery Backlog]]. 
	2.  If more complex, complete an initial [[Opportunity Assessment#High-Level|High-Level Opportunity Assessment]] for the item that would serve as enough guidance to form a potential [[How we built this playbook#Initiative|Initiative]] to perform discovery on this.
	3.  Review the current teams and their objectives to see if this opportunity fits well within their lane. Mark the expected team. Remember, if one current team has too many opportunities to drive, and there is the budget, this is an opportunity to decompose a team to allow more progress against a high-priority set of initiatives.
3.  Review well-aged items to see if they lack relevancy enough to archive them, or if they deserve being refreshed given changes in the business and product.
