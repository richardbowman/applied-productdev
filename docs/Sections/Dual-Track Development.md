# Dual Track Development

## Delivery

Most of us are very familiar with this cycle. We've gotten pretty good at it. Most teams are using either Kanban or Scrum-based processes to deliver product capabilities to end users.

This playbook assumes the team is using a Scrum-based delivery process with a set cadence, typically two weeks in length. Fixing time in scrum is a mechanism for creating one constraint in the traditional project management triad.

## Discovery

This cycle is typically the area that we ether aren't performing in any legitimate way, or is highly ad-hoc. Because this area is less defined by typical methodologies, the playbook will spend more time creating a structure for this lane.

### Cycles
One thing we'll have to keep in mind here is that it is much harder to declare a certain structured cycle for product discovery. If you do, you'll inevitably just start arriving at sunk-cost based choices where you budgeted 3mo for a discovery initiative, and whatever came out of the research will get built whether or not is a good idea or not. Its key here to try to kill a lot of ideas in the search of one that stands out. Ideally a discovery cycle could be as short as a day, and you might have several iterations within a single traditional iteration.

In Jeff Patton's diagram, he represents this with lots more cycles in discovery happening than in the development sprints.

### Ceremonies
We recommend using the same cycle and sharing ceremonies across both product discovery and delivery, and just segregating time within key ceremonies to allow for the planning and progression of both lanes. It keeps the full pod integrated in both discovery and delivery even if in planning process you carve off a portion of the team that will be executing portions of either lane.
