# Solution Framing Workshop

## Introduction
Framing is the initial step in basically honing the problem space we really think is valuable to potentially invest further in. Framing is incredibly relevant to do as a full team



## When to use
When a team is taking on a new opportunity, or even as a reset for an initiative that has gotten off-track or didn't start with a proper framing session, host this workshop.

## How to run (PR-FAQ Framing)
This workshop agenda and associated templates can help the team run a framing exercise leveraging the Press Release & FAQ concept evangelized by Amazon. This is a great technique to create a narrative for our intentions around solving a problem and the outcomes we hope to drive.

 The leaders who groomed this opportunity may not be the same people as the actual team now taking on further discovery. In this case, those original high-level framers should join this workshop and share as much context as possible.
 
 1. Intro to the process (if this team hasn't done this before)
 2. Current Framing - what hypothesis do we have? what's already been researched?
 3. What's the big idea?
